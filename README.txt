@Coachell
Coachell is a world-class music and arts festival that host some of the most innovative and celebrated artist of our time. Attendees of the festival come from all over to experience a one of a kind festival. Many of the attendees chose to share their experience with their Instagram followers. For our intalation we will create an art installation that turns popular Instagram photos of Coachella and live video feed into an analog image on a flip dot displays that are arranged to look like polaroid photos that are arranged as if hanging on a clothesline. The installation will have a different sizes of flip dot displays that cycle through different images. There will even be one that allows users to interact with it through an Instagram live account.

To do this we create six large flip dot displays in the shape of polaroid photos that hang froma massive cloths line. The displays will be made by AlfaZeta Flip-Dot. The displays will be showing images grabed by a computer in one of the poles. The computer will run a scraper through Touchdesigner and sending a RS-485 signal to the displays. For one side of the the displays we will see instagram photos grabed from diffrent hashtags. On the other side will be live video feed coming from the PTZ Optics Z Cams that are instaled in the displays. These cams have built-in NDI compatibility so that we can send all video feed down a network cable and into Touchdesigner.

A detailed system diagram is in this folder.
